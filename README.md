**Welcome to the WEEDME**

**Summary:**

This was my 4th and final project for General Assembly&#39;s 12-week Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp, to be completed with neither instructor or TA nor assistance or collaboration from peers in a one-week timeframe. This is a passion project, as cannabis is a pleasure I am a connoisseur of, along with coffee, beer, whiskey, cigars, you name it.

I wanted an app to keep track of what I&#39;ve tried as well as help me find new strains to try. This was also developed as a portfolio piece for applying to work with Leafly. It stretched my abilities and taught me many practical lessons.

**User Stories:**

&quot;I am a regular / new user of medical or recreational cannabis and I want to know what strain is best for me.&quot;

**Technologies Used:**

-Mongoose

-React

-Express

-Node.js

-The Strain API: http://strains.evanbusse.com/

**Developer Notes:**

-The API chosen lacked clear and robust documentation so a lot of guesswork, research, and trial and error was employed to be able to get it to the functionality it is presently on. While it works splendidly hosted locally, troubles arose during launching it on Heroku.

**Known Bugs and Issues:**

-Issues arose with deployment. While able to host the site on Heroku, issues arose with the API calls due to mixed content errors between HTTP and HTTPS calls. This learning experience has taught me to write routes from the back end whenever possible and deepen my planning phase to account for such errors. As this was a student project, it was hard to foresee everything that could go wrong.
